## GitHub tutorial 1: Installing the software to use GitHub from RStudio.

What date and time you prefer? https://goo.gl/B2yBq6

This tutorial is for those that want to install or configure the software during the tutorial (this is painful and time consuming). 

Contents: This is a good guide for what contents we will cover: http://happygitwithr.com/

> Getting all the necessary software installed, configured, and playing nicely together is honestly half the battle here. Brace yourself for some pain. The upside is that you can give yourself a pat on the back once you get through this. And you WILL get through this.

## GitHub tutorial 2: Using GitHub from RStudio

What day and time you prefer? https://goo.gl/KJmtR7

This tutorial is for those with a GitHub account, that have already installed Git (Git is the engine of GitHub), R and RStudio; these people configured it all but haven't fully incorporated these tools into their workflow.

Contents: These are good guide for what contents we may cover:

## GitHub tutorial 3: Using git beyond RStudio; the GitHub Work Flow, with master and issue-branches

What day and time you prefer? https://goo.gl/HEooiw

This tutorial is for those that use GitHub but want to use branches and Git from a shell to get more power.

Contents: I will cover the GitHub workflow: https://goo.gl/Gx2SYn. To learn other workflows see this article: https://goo.gl/EzSuwQ.
