GitHub tutorial 1: Installing the software to use GitHub from RStudio.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What date and time you prefer? <https://goo.gl/B2yBq6>

This tutorial is for those that want to install or configure the software during the tutorial (this is painful and time consuming).

Contents: This is a good guide for what contents we will cover: <http://happygitwithr.com/>

> Getting all the necessary software installed, configured, and playing nicely together is honestly half the battle here. Brace yourself for some pain. The upside is that you can give yourself a pat on the back once you get through this. And you WILL get through this.

GitHub tutorial 2: Using GitHub from RStudio
--------------------------------------------

What day and time you prefer? <https://goo.gl/KJmtR7>

This tutorial is for those with a GitHub account, that have already installed Git (Git is the engine of GitHub), R and RStudio; these people configured it all but haven't fully incorporated these tools into their workflow.

Contents: These are good guide for what contents we may cover: - <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html>. - <http://happygitwithr.com/>

GitHub tutorial 3: Using git beyond RStudio; the GitHub Work Flow, with master and issue-branches
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What day and time you prefer? <https://goo.gl/HEooiw>

This tutorial is for those that use GitHub but want to use branches and Git from a shell to get more power.

Contents: I will cover the GitHub workflow: <https://goo.gl/Gx2SYn>. To learn other workflows see this article: <https://goo.gl/EzSuwQ>.
