Proposed tutorials and people in each
================

Below is a list of proposed topics for tutorials, and of people interested in each (so far). If you want to propose or join a tutorial, follow [this issue](https://github.com/forestgeo/forum/issues/2) or email <maurolepore@gmail.com>.

Most people is interested in GitHub. I think GitHub tutorials may need 3 levels:

1.  For those that want to install or configure the software during the tutorial (this is painful and time consuming);
2.  For those that have already installed Git, R and RStudio, and configured it all; but haven't fully incorporated these tools into their workflow;
3.  For those that can GitHub from RStudio, but want the extra power of the Git shell to branch their projects and adhere to the GitHub workflow.

If you have an opinion let me know soon. I'll make a decision soon and will let you know.

Setting up GitHub and RStudio
-----------------------------

Installing the software to use GitHub from RStudio.

> Getting all the necessary software installed, configured, and playing nicely together is honestly half the battle here. Brace yourself for some pain. The upside is that you can give yourself a pat on the back once you get through this. And you WILL get through this.

### Prefer intermediate level

Using git outside RStudio, with a shell. This allows to create branches and to adhere to follow the [GitHub workflow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). That is the workflow I will present. To learn other workflows see [this article](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
